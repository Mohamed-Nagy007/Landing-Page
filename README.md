## Landing Page Project
This Is My First Project Using Javascript And All The Skills That I Learned During The Course

#### So, What I did is 
* At First, I Created The Whole Navigation Bar Using The Javascript.
* I Made Two Add New Section Buttons One In The Navigation Bar And The Other 
At The End Of The Page. 
* While You're Scrolling You'll Find Some Effects In The Background Of That Section That You're Looking At.
* Also While You're Scrolling Each Section That You'll See You'll Find That It Has Different Background Color At The Navigation Bar
* If You Clicked On Any Section In The Navigation Bar It Will Automatically Move To That Chosen Section.
* If You Scroll Down You'll Find A Scroll Up Button On The Left Side If You Click It, It'll Automatically Move To The Top Of The Page.

#### These Are The Main Features OF That Project.
